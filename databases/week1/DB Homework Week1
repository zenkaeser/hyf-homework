1. Find out how many tasks are in the task table
	SELECT COUNT(id) FROM task;
2. Find out how many tasks in the task table do not have a valid due date
	SELECT COUNT(*) - COUNT(due_date) FROM task;
3. Find all the tasks that are marked as done
	SELECT task.id, title, description, status.name FROM task
			JOIN status
			ON task.status_id = status.id
			WHERE status_id = 3;
4. Find all the tasks that are not marked as done
	SELECT task.id, title, description, status.name FROM task
			JOIN status
			ON task.status_id = status.id
			WHERE status_id <> 3;
5. Get all the tasks, sorted with the most recently created first
	SELECT * FROM TASK ORDER BY created DESC;
6. Get the single most recently created task
	SELECT * FROM TASK ORDER BY created DESC LIMIT 0,1;
7. Get the title and due date of all tasks where the title or description contains database
	SELECT title, due_date FROM TASK 
			WHERE title LIKE "%database%" OR description LIKE "%database%";
8. Get the title and status (as text) of all tasks
	SELECT title, status.name AS status FROM task
		    LEFT JOIN status
		    on task.status_id = status_id;
9. Get the name of each status, along with a count of how many tasks have that status
	SELECT status.name, count(task.id) AS "task count" FROM status
			JOIN task
			ON status.id = task.status_id
			GROUP BY status.name;
10. Get the names of all statuses, sorted by the status with most tasks first
	SELECT status.name, count(task.id) AS "task count" FROM status
			JOIN task
			ON status.id = task.status_id
			GROUP BY status.name
			ORDER BY count(task.id) DESC
